                    <dd>
                        <span class="course-title">Network Fundamentals</span> went over more advanced IT and networking topics with diagnosis and practice in Cisco Packet Tracer. This course taught what was needed for the CompTIA Network+ certification exam. While I decided not to attempt this certification, I learned a good amount of networking topics that I have utilized when working on my home network(s).

                    <dt class="CMIT"><span class="course-code">CMIT 100</span> [CSCI Elective] - <span class="course-title">Introduction to Information Technology</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2022-12-17">Dec 17, 2022</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        I decided to take this course as I figured it would be beneficial in my new role as a Software Developer and Support person. This class covered the basics of computers, networking, and IT tasks.

                    <dt class="MATH"><span class="course-code">MATH 225</span> - <span class="course-title">Discrete Mathematics</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2022-05-17">May 17, 2022</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <span class="course-title">Discrete Mathematics</span> was another course that threw me off as it, like <span class="course-title">Statistics</span>, relies heavily on language and the way things are worded. 
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="CSCI"><span class="course-code">CSCI 290</span> - <span class="course-title">Data Structures</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2022-05-17">May 17, 2022</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <span class="course-title">Data Structures</span> was another challenging class, but I believe it was due in-part to difficult projects with lacking instructions. This course had us create our own sorting and searching algorithms, and data types. While there are better ways to store data, we created our own data type and sorting/searching algorithms to manipulate and manage this data.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="MATH"><span class="course-code">MATH 190</span> [CSCI Elective] - <span class="course-title">Pre-Calculus</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2021-12-18">Dec 18, 2021</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        I don't remember a lot from my <span class="course-title">Pre-Calculus</span> course as I believe it was sort of "just another math class," but it did challenge me on concepts I had to remember from my <span class="course-title">Intro to Trigonometry course</span>. If I had not taken that intro class there are some concepts that I would've struggled much more with such as the unit circle.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="CSCI"><span class="course-code">CSCI 250</span> [CSCI Elective] - <span class="course-title">Computer Organization</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2021-12-18">Dec 18, 2021</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        The name of the class may be misleading, when joining this course I made the assumption that it would be file structures, proper techniques around file hierarchies and computer usage tips and tricks. <span class="course-title">Computer Organization</span> was actually an assembly class in disguise. While we were taught about how computers work down to the bits, the majority of the work revolved around the assembly language. This class did involve one of my favorite projects that I've worked on, the Towers of Hanoi project. Where we had to use recursion and memory calls through Assembly. As someone who had never used assembly, when the project finally worked as expected with minimal instructions (aside from how it should work), I was shocked and thrilled at the same time. I was so proud of myself for creating this project on my own with processes and ideas we learned in class. This was, by no means, an easy class and I earned my second B due to the difficulty of computing concepts. One thing that has been very beneficial in future classes and personal projects is being able to convert binary to decimal or hexadecimal, and visa-versa.

                    <dt class="MATH"><span class="course-code">MATH 155</span> - <span class="course-title">Statistics</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2021-05-15">May 15, 2021</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        I wasn't expecting my <span class="course-title">Statistics</span> class to be as challenging as it was, but it was less of a math class and more of a language arts class in some ways. This class required a lot of focus and attention to detail when analyzing data. Simply missing a plural word and assuming it's singular could change the entire meaning of the data being analyzed. This course had a heavy emphasis on excel sheets and advanced techniques, so it definitely helped me learn more about excel. Because I came into this class with the expectation that it would be a math class, I struggled with identifying certain minor details in texts and this managed to land me my first B grade.

                    <dt class="POLS"><span class="course-code">POLS 110</span> - <span class="course-title">Introduction to International Relations</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2021-05-15">May 15, 2021</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        This political science class challenged my communication between peers and my ability to discover information in texts and online resources that was pertinent to the topic(s) at hand. We also had group assignments where we would take turns responding to questions and building off of or contradicting what our group mates wrote.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="CSCI"><span class="course-code">CSCI 160</span> - <span class="course-title">Object Oriented Design/Programming</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2021-05-15">May 15, 2021</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        One of my favorite topics in programming is OOP/D (Object Oriented Programming and Design). Thinking about how objects interact, their attributes, and functionality draws my interest. Since having almost 10 years in on-and-off personal development with Minecraft mods and server plugins, I already had a ton of experience, so this was a great practice class where I was able to show off my knowledge.

                    <dt class="MATH"><span class="course-code">MATH 140</span> - <span class="course-title">College Algebra</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2020-12-19">Dec 19, 2020</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        Algebra is not my strongest class topic, despite how much I love math. This class definitely strained me, especially when taking 3 other courses and working full-time retail hours. Regardless, I got to practice algebraic expressions and learned how to manage stress.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="CSCI"><span class="course-code">CSCI 110</span> - <span class="course-title">Principles of Computer Science</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2020-12-19">Dec 19, 2020</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        In my <span class="course-title">Principles of Computer Science</span> course, I worked on a handful of more basic development projects, but learned a lot in the process!
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="MATH"><span class="course-code">MATH 146</span> - <span class="course-title">Introduction to Trigonometry</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2020-10-24">Oct 24, 2020</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        <span class="course-title">Introduction to Trigonometry</span> was a great start to my pre-calulus course as it focused very heavily on trigonometry and not many other topics.
                    </dd>
                    <dt class="FIGS"><span class="course-code">FIGS 100</span> - <span class="course-title">Student Success: Meet the Romans of Pompeii</span> <time class="course-completed" datetime="2020-10-24">Oct 24, 2020</time></dt>
                    <dd>
                        During my time in my freshman interest group course, I learned about successful notetaking processes as well as got acquanted with brightspace and SMCC processes.
